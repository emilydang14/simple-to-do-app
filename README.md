# TO DO LIST APP

## Introduction
To do web application is the very basic application to learn when It comes to React Js. The application helps a person to understand the concept of props and state clearly. Understanding how to pass props and managing state through out the application and through different layer of components is the very basic concept that every ReactJs learner should know. 

I wrote these code on those first day learning to program with ReactJs. This excersie gave me more deep understanding about state and props. Beside that, I implement React Transition Group to give some basic animation for the application.

## Technology used: 
  - React Js: React Class
  - React Transition Group

## How the application works?

You can:
1. Adding new notes
2. Editing existing notes
3. Delete notes

## How to start the application on your computer:

1. Write `npm start` to run

2. If it shows error: `react-scripts: command not found`
  - Run `npm install` : this to make sure all the dependencies were installed
  - Run `npm start` to start the application
